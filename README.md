## 🧐 About

- 🔭 I am a dedicated GitHub user who joined the platform on November 27, 2021, with a commitment to personal projects and sharing my work with others.
- 🌱 My programming journey has involved diverse languages, including Rust, C++, HTML, JavaScript, Python, and TypeScript. I enjoy exploring and working with different technologies.
- 😄 I have a strong engagement with the programming community and have actively contributed to my projects with a total of 27 commits since account creation. This reflects my commitment to maintaining and improving my codebases.
- 🛠️ I enjoy solving coding problems using Rust and have dedicated a repository called "cses-rust" towards that purpose. This reflects my interest in competitive programming and practicing algorithms to enhance my problem-solving skills.
- 💻 I also have a custom-built C++ implementation of the Unix Word Count tool, named "wc-clone-". This project highlights my inclination towards systems-level programming and demonstrates my ability to work on low-level projects.
- 🚀 I am always open to collaboration and enjoy helping beginners contribute to open-source projects. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if you're looking for a collaborator for your project.
